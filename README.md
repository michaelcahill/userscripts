# Michael's userscripts

I install these scripts in Chrome to make it easier to track what is going on: one changes mentions of tickets on GitHub into links to MongoDB's JIRA site.  The other changes ticket numbers in WiredTiger's documentation into links to GitHub issues.

Instructions on how to install a script into Chrome directly are here:

Alternatively, consider using the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
